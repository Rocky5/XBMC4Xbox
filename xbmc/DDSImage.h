      DDS FILE FORMAT MODIFICATION FOR PRE-PADDED TEXTURES

      Original reserved area: 
      uint32_t      reserved[11];
      
      This modification uses the last 3 dwords of space in the 1st reserved area to store
      the actual size of the image data (as opposed to the texture size). The DDS file
      format was not designed to be used pre-padded - this modification was necessary
      in order to support it. Having the textures pre-padded on disk saves quite a bit of
      work, since otherwise we would have to manually pad the texture to POT procedurally
      and then clamp the edges off - this allows us to avoid that. See GetOrgWidth() and
      GetOrgHeight() in DDSImage.cpp
